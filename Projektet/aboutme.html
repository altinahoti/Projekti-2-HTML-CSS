				<p><font color="#004432" >I always liked Computer Sciences since I was child.<br>I have always found technology interesting.<br>
					In my free time I watched many movies about technology and robots.<br>And I read many books by famous programer as <b>Mark L Chambers<b/>.</font>
						<h3><font color="red"> Why did I choose Computer Sciences?</font></h3>
						<p><font color="blue">As kid I read a lot of science fiction novels with computers,<br> and my dream started to grow so much for this branch.<br>What attracted me in this direction is the ability to solve many problems.<br>
						And the amazing thing is that all of these problems that science is trying to solve <br> through modern algorithms are similar to the problems that we are constantly dealing with. <br> 
						The constant development of technology, made new things, discoveries, <br> inventions and our ability to create different things constantly.The urge to create new things,<br> to constantly experiment and control the operation of computers, prompted me to study this field.</font></p>
